	            <p>"Like so many start up businesses, I built our first website on a shoestring. It looked cheap, meaning we lost customers and sales, I knew it was time to invest in a professionally designed website. The end result is a website that not only looks really modern and professional, but also a website that does what it is meant to do â€“ sell! The website now has a smooth journey from the home page to signing up, and this has definitely resulted in an increase in sales. Best of all we can manage and update the website through a very easy-to-use content management system."</p>
